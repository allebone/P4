> **Note:**

> - All of the links and necessary resources are hosted within a Digital Ocean Droplet at the above link (and requisite sub folders). Additionally, the DNS Name Services are provided through the educational assistance program of NameCheap.com. I chose to allow NameCheap to continue to maintain the Name Server control (of forwarding) for the time being, as I didn't want to complicate matters with propagation delay.
