> **Note:**

> - All of the links and necessary resources are hosted within a Digital Ocean Droplet at the above link (and requisite sub folders). Additionally, the DNS Name Services are provided through the educational assistance program of NameCheap.com. I chose to allow NameCheap to continue to maintain the Name Server control (of forwarding) for the time being, as I didn't want to complicate matters with propagation delay.

### Outside Dependencies and Citation

The following items were included for attached rationale:

	

 --**Twitter Bootstrap Framework**
 
	[Bootstrap GitHub](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)
	
	Utilizing the Bootstrap Framework gave me the opportunity to uniformly present information within my site. Its requisite theme from CSS is also represented below as a utilized dependency. The color mapping, sized character depictions, and quick implementation of anchored areas are unparallelled for a fledgling designer. 
	
 --**JQuery and JQuery Countdown Plug-in**
	
	[Jquery Countdown](http://hilios.github.io/jQuery.countdown/)
	
	Graphical depictions created by JQuery plug-ins just manage to accomplish more with less code.  In this context, JQuery is only utilized on the attached temporary "Under Contruction" site for each project.  Each has a countdown timer with a "No Later Than Date" for each project's Due Date. 

 --**Bootstrap Theme (.css)**
 
	I don't have the luxury of time/experience to create eye pleasing color palates, and functional design.  Twitter is generous enough to provide these under reusable  licensing terms. I altered them (within the confines of the licensing structure) to facilitate features/color schemes within my design.  I've listed this separately due to its alteration within Licensing. 

--**Font Awesome 4.1.0**

	[Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)I utilized the Font Awesome inclusions so that I could use the their fancy Icon Sets. For instance, Facebook, LinkedIn, GitHub, and Pied Piper are the only icons used in the contact area: doing more with less in terms of visual appeal.Also, there are LESS versions and pre-processing already apparent for efficiency.
